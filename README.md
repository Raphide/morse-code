A Morse code translation app to demonstrate being able to iterate through objects, use Regex, manipulate the DOM and perform unit testing on the code.

This application is able to translate alphanumeric characters to morse code and back. The English to Morse Code translator only handles letters and numbers so it only allows those (and spaces) to be typed into the input. 

similarly the Morse Code input only allows for periods, dashes and spaces and only recognizes Morse Code symbols between A-Z and 0-9 (it will throw an error if invalid codes are submitted).

Morse code that goes through the English to Morse Code translator is returned with single spaces between letters and double spaces between words. The Morse Code to English translator accepts morse code in the same format and will return letters with no spaces inbetween and words with single spacing.
